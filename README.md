The A/B Testing project involves the use of the Chi-Square Test of Independence to assess the effectiveness of a proposed product ad for a marketing agency. Group A 
comprises the control which entails customers who saw the product on public displays. Group B is the experimental group constituting customers who were exposed to 
the said ad. Using chi-square, we determine whether the difference in outcome(customer buying product) is statistically significant between the two groups.
