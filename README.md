The A/B Testing project involves the use of the Chi-Square Test of Independence to assess the effectiveness of a proposed product ad for a marketing agency. Group A comprises the control which entails customers who saw the product on public displays. Group B is the experimental group constituting customers who were exposed to the said ad. Using chi-square, we determine whether the difference in outcome(customer buying product) is statistically significant between the two groups. 

The second project entails the use of the Logistic Regression model trained on housing data in California such as median income, median house value, house median age, and bedroom-to-household ratio. Having trained this model on the data, it is used to predict median house values given test parameters.
